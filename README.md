# Learning Methods
The Login Page, Registration Page, and Home Page were made by following along with this recent video
by ProgrammingKnowledge on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss_tLc7WSkg <br> <br>
After gaining an understanding of the syntax and generally how to utilize Android Studio and Flutter,
I used Claude 4 to help generate code snippets and added them piece by piece manually, rather than
using an AI tool integrated into the IDE, such as Cursor. This helped deepen my understanding of creating
robust and well-designed pages via dart files.
